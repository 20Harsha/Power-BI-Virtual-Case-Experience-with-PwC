Power BI Virtual Case Experience with PwC provides an opportunity to solve real world business scenarios using Power BI.This experience consists of three case studies they are :
* Call Centre Trends (Visualising customer and agent behaviour) 
* Customer Retention (Customer demographics and insights)
* Diversity & Inclusion (Gender balance in the executive suite)

# Call Centre Trends (Visualising customer and agent behaviour) 

This case study deals with the Call Centre Trends. Here, we analyze the number of incoming calls, total calls answered, speed of calls answered, average call duration, overall satisfaction rating etc. To observe agents performance we can filter agents based on the requirement.The goal is to identify where the performance can be monitored and enhanced.

# Customer Retention (Customer demographics and insights)

The organisation is keen to know the possible customers who are likely to churn. In this Dashboard, we are analyzing
* Services for which each customer is signed up for like phone, internet, online security etc.
* Customer account info like payment method, monthly charges, contract etc.
* Customer demographics like gender, dependents, partner.

# Diversity & Inclusion (Gender balance in the executive suite)

Here, we create a dashboard in order to analyze gender balance in the organization. We could observe employee total count as well as gender wise number of employees. We could analyze hire count gender wise, performance rating, gender wise promotion, department wise gender count etc. Enabling diversity and eliminating gender-based stereotyping is key to the balanced workforce and company success.
